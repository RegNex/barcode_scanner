## To set up an emulator
* Select Run > Run 'app' OR open a terminal in the Project and type 'flutter run'
* Click 'Create New Emulator'
* Select the device you would like to emulate (Recommended: pixel xl2)
* Select the API level you would like to run - click 'Download' if not available (Recommended: Marshmallow - ABI: x86)

* Click 'Finish' and allow Emulator to run

## To Run on an Android OS Device
* Connect the device to the computer through its USB port
* Make sure USB debugging is enabled (this may pop up in a window when you connect the device or it may need to be checked in the phone's settings)
* Select Run > Run 'app' OR open a terminal in the Project and type 'flutter run'
* Select the device (If it does not show, USB debugging is probably not enabled)
* Click 'OK'
